-- Note that I have modified this script slightly to include snaps with 0 executions.
-- This is to account for situations with very long running statements (that generally
-- cross snapshot boundaries). In these situations, the executions_delta is incremented 
-- in the snapshot when the statement begins. There will be 0 executions_delta in
-- subsequent snapshots, but the time and lio's should still be considered.
